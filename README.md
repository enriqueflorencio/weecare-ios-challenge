# Notes From Enrique Florencio

Hello and thank you so much for letting me work on such an interesting project! I had a ton of fun putting my knowledge to the test and I tried my absolute best to be creative as possible! 

For the challenge, I tried to replicate WeeCare's gradient color into the app by using CAGradientLayer for the main VC's background color. I'm not sure if I was close but I definitely tried to nail the correct RGB values. I then decided to switch out the current table view for a collection view in order to get a double column layout for a 'modern' approach as described by the client. I also thought that it would be fun to see how well this layout could work across different device orientations (landscape left/right). I'm not sure if this was a right decision, design wise, but I wanted to take a jab at it! I also thought that it would be a fun challenge to give users a menu to select how they want their albums displayed when they tap on the navigation bar button! 

Last Remarks:
  I had a ton of fun working on this project and if I could continue working on it I would focus more on the following things:
  - Make the constraints/sizes work smoothly across different iPad devices.
  - Rearchitect to a MVVM approach. I prioritized maintaining a balanced MVC pattern and UI design along with other specifications.
  - Implement more Unit Tests and adding UI Tests.
  - Documenting my code a bit more.
